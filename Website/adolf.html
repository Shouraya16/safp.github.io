                    <div class="factlist">
                        <p>-Hitler, as a child wanted to be an artist. When he couldn't get entry into the art school he wanted, he went on his villain arc and joined the army</p>
                        <p>-Hitler was a fan of Superman, therefore he got inspired by his flying pose and made it into his salute</p>
                        <p>-Hitler was known to have a hatred for "juice" and wanted to remove it from existence. He kind of succeeded by infusing some gas into the juice and decreased the stock by about 6 million units.This was also called "The Holocaust"</p>
                        <p>-Hitler had his moustache inspired from Jethalal in "Tarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chashma". It is said that he used to watch that show with his family everyday</p>
                        <p>-Hitler was said to have His moustache stuffed with cocaine, so that he could feel "Higher than everybody else". The lyrics of the song "Highest in the room" by Travis Scott was actually what Hitler experienced during this shit</p>
                        <p>-Hitler had no children, implying that he was bad, not only as a person, but also as partner in bed</p>
                        <p>-According to recent research, in 1941 his personal physician, Theodor Morell, began injecting him with various drugs, including oxycodone, methamphetamine, morphine, and even cocaine. In fact, drug use was reportedly prevalent throughout the Nazi Party, and soldiers were often given meth before battle. </p>
                        <p>-Near the end of his life, Hitler was prone to shaking, and, while some have attributed this to Parkinson disease, others have speculated it was withdrawal from drugs, as they were hard to get by that time.</p>
