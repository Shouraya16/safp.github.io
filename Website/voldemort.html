                   <h2>Facts About Voldy: </h2>
                   <div class="factlist">
                        <p>-Voldemort was born to a muggle father and a witch mother and his father had left him soon after he was born. This was a very American behaviour by the father, even though he was British</p>
                        <p>-Voldemort's real name was Tom Marvolo Riddle. His mother named him after his father, Tom Riddle and his middle name from his maternal grandpa, Marvolo Gaunt</p>
                        <p>-Voldemort was obsessed with power. That's why he was desperately after Dumbledore's long brown stick üòè(Elder Wand). He thought having Dumbledore's stick would make him stronger than anyone, which led him to digging up Dumbledore's grave and taking his stick</p>
                        <p>-Voldy was basically a pussy. He was so scared of little baby Harry potter that he wanted to kill him as a child. And bro almost died from thatüòÇ. What a loser</p>
                        <p>Next One is a Spoiler to the 8th book. If you are planning on reading it, skip it</p>
                        <p>-In the book "Harry Potter: The cursed child", It was told that Voldy had a daughter. With Bellatrix Lestrange. And Harry's son has a crush on her. Like wtf? She is the offspring of two of the worst looking characters. Fuckin Emma watson is right there have a crush on her bro (I know she is his aunt but still.... She's Emma Watson). Why Her??</p>
                        <p>-Voldemort is said to be a distant relative of "Surpanakha" from "Ramayana". This seems true, given their chopped off noses.</p>
                        <p>-Voldemort was his class' Topper, House Prefect, Head boy. Still he turned out like this. That means your marks don't matter in your life ahead. I wanna tell this to my mother but I will get slapped so writing it here.</p>
