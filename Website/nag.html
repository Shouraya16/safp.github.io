                       <p>-He has used his neurons to study about neural links and now fucks up the mental of students in this college</p>
                       <p>-He is very fond of food, which can be obvious and spends a lot of his time doing his favourite activity</p>
                       <p>-He is currently unmarried and live on the campus of IIITG</p>
                       <p>-Sometimes I feel bad for him, for the way he lives and all but then he does something and my old viewpoints return</p>

                       <p>-He is a good teacher tbf, the fact that he likes to see his students in despair is kinda scary</p>
                       <p>-That's all for him. I mean I can't stay much stuff about him yet bcz at this point I respect him somewhat because he was a good and cool teacher in our batch, but if shit goes down, I might add to this webpage</p>
                       <p>-Also, I know this website is not that good but I had to go out on 30th may which left me with very less time to study and implement therefore this website was made in like 5-6 ish hours</p>
