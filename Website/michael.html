                       <p>-People, after reading the above fact may feel that he changed his color after getting famous. The catch is, Yes, He literally did change his color. MJ had Vitiligo which led to him turning white. Bro legit changed his race</p>
                       <p>-MJ is one of the few people who can give competition to the Kardashians for the amount of plastic on their face, as he is said to have had a lot of plastic surgeries conducted on him</p>
                       <p>-Michael jackson was especially fond of kids during his lifetime. Some people say he was a bit too fond (In a bad way) of them, but most of the people believe otherwise</p>
                       <p>-Michael was termed as the "King of pop" because of his amazing songs and hits. Billie Jean is one of my favourites </p>
                       <p>-MJ's death caused by a cardiac arrest due to a lethal combination of sedatives and propofol, an anesthetic was a shock to the world. It was later found that Jackson's personal physician was responsible for this involuntary manslaughter</p>
